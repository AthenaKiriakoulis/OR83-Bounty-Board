# OR83BountyBoard
This interactive bounty board is designed to help teams delegate and track tasks during game development. Inspired by the in-game bounty boards where players pick tasks, this tool allows tasks to be placed on a game map according to their location within the game. Developers can then assign themselves to specific tasks directly from the map. The bounty board was created for the development of OR83, a video game project at Stevens Institute of Technology, where many sections of the game are completed based on the game map. This tool ensures that tasks are clearly organized and efficiently managed throughout the development process.
